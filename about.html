		<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>A Rhode Islander by way of Albequerque, New Mexico, Liz moved to Greenville in 2010 when her mother transferred to the GSP Southwest Airlines team.  </p>
			<p>Josh, however, is a lifelong South Carolinian who had barely left the state prior to meeting Liz.</p>
			<p>The two first met in October 2010, after establishing communications on an online dating website. After a few months of trying to coordinate schedules to date, things began to get serious around Christmastime of that year. Since then, they have adopted a dog and a cat, had many travel adventures together, and stuck together through the many ups and downs each has experienced.</p>

		<h3>Our Adventures Together</h3>
			<p>While Liz, a child of two airline employees, was a seasoned traveler when they first met, Josh had barely been outside the southeast! Liz enabled and encouraged Josh to get out of his comfort zone and the two have been on many adventures together. As they both share a love of sports (even if they can't always agree on which sports), many of them have involved traveling for sporting events:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Boston, MA</li>
				<li>Las Vegas, NV (twice!)</li>
				<li>Seattle, WA</li>
				<li>Atlanta, GA</li>
				<li>Rhode Island</li>
				<li>New York, NY</li>
				<li>Josh's first NASCAR race - Coca Cola 600 in Charlotte, NC</li>
				<li>Liz's first soccer game - Liverpool vs Roma in Boston</li>
			</ul>
